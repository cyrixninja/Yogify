It's a Downward Dog Pose
Downward dog pose is a full-body stretch that has many benefits:

1.Stretches the lower body- The inversion of downward dog helps you get into position to stretch the hamstrings, calves, and ankles fully.

2.Strengthens the upper body- Downward dog is a weight-bearing exercise, so it’s effective at building strength in your shoulders and arms. This yoga pose also engages your midsection to help build strong abdominal muscles.

3.Stimulates blood flow- Downward dog is a position that places your heart above your head, allowing gravity to increase blood flow and improve your circulation.

4.Improves posture- Downward dog opens up the chest and shoulders, which can help straighten your vertebrae and align your spine, leading to overall improved posture.

5.Fine-tunes your foot muscles- This pose stretches and strengthens the major muscles and bones in your body and the smaller muscles in your feet, like the plantar fascia, which is the ligament that connects the heel to the front of the foot. Strengthening this part of your body can improve your walking and help prevent injury to this area when you’re performing more strenuous physical activity"""

It's a Plank Pose

Benefits to Practicing Plank Pose Every Day

1. Strengthens Your Core
When it comes to building core strength, Plank Pose reigns supreme due to its ability to work all four muscle groups in the stomach . . . oh, you thought you only had “abs?” Plank strengthens the rectus abdominis (visual “six-pack” muscles), transverse abdominis (deep core stabilizing muscles), and the internal and external obliques (hip and back mobilizing muscles).

2. Increases Muscle Definition
Along with your abdomen, Plank Pose also strengthens the muscles in your shoulders, chest, legs, and back. The functionality of this pose combined with the isometric hold helps strengthen and build lean muscle to increase overall muscle definition on the body.

3. Heightens Metabolism
The muscle strength and mass that can be attained through Plank Pose offers another incredible benefit to go along with those stronger and more defined muscles . . . a faster metabolism! When you increase your muscle mass, you boost your resting metabolic heart rate, in turn resulting in greater calorie burn, according to Exercise Physiologist Katie Heimburger.

4. Reduces Back Pain
As your abdominal muscles become stronger, the body becomes less reliant on the overuse and overextension of the back muscles. Instead, your body resorts to the now stronger core for everyday activities and exercise, which reduces pain in the lower back.

5. Gives You Better Posture
Achieving better posture is most easily done by ensuring the spine, mid, and upper body muscles are strong and healthy. As you practice Plank Pose, the back, chest, shoulders, abs, and neck engage and work hard to organically adjust your body’s natural alignment.

6. Improves Balance
The isometric hold used during Plank Pose encourages your body to manifest stability as a whole. This, in turn, creates an overall improvement in your balance and coordination. Learning to keep your body stabilized during this difficult horizontal hold ultimately enhances your ability to stabilize in the more natural vertical state.

7. Enhances Bone and Joint Health
Plank Pose allows you to engage in weight-bearing physical activities while reducing the harsh and painful side effects often associated with exercises such as jumping and running.
When you perform Plank, new living bone tissue is created, resulting in both healthier and stronger bones. The physical activity done during this exercise also promotes circulation in the joints, which allows the bones to move past one another in a smoother fashion.

8. Boosts Mood and Relieves Stress
Practicing Plank Pose, or any physical activity, releases a neurochemical substance in the brain called endorphins, which are known to increase feelings of happiness and decrease feelings of stress. This pose can also aid in tension relief, as your body is encouraged to stretch and lengthen when performing the pose.
