# Yogify
The project is submitted to the hackathon **Codetivate**.

## Inspiration
It’s normal to have moments where you may feel dissatisfied, unhappy, or uncomfortable in your own body. But if you find these feelings increasing or intensifying, a more serious issue may be developing.

## What it does
We have chat services and features covering issues and topics of Mental well-being. It contains features on topics such as physical fitness, mental health, and several other related topics.

## Yoga trainer
The app uses your smartphone camera to capture your posture and movements. It then uses AI and machine learning to determine whether you’re doing exercises such as the plank the right way. The Yoga Classifier Classifies your yoga Position on the basis of which pose you're doing. Currently, it supports Five Poses - Goddess, Plank, Tree, Downdog, and Warrior. It would help you classify your yoga poses in a better way

## Emotion Classifier
It’s normal to have moments where you may feel dissatisfied, unhappy, or uncomfortable in your own body. But if you find these feelings increasing or intensifying, a more serious issue may be developing.
Learn about your mental health and ways to maintain a healthy headspace. The Emotional Classifier Features classifies your emotions according to the feelings you would right and gives you an emotional chart about your feelings. This truly helps you to identify how are you really feeling. This Feature is built using NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) in Python

## Consult feature 
If your mental or emotional state quickly gets worse, or you're worried about someone you know - help is available. You're not alone; talk to someone you trust. Sharing a problem is often the first step to recovery.

## Chatbot feature
Helps you to answer all your queries anytime you want related to Health issues, Diets, and many other health-related things that would help you to lead a healthy lifestyle.

## How we built it
We made it using HMTL, CSS, Javascript, Python, NLP, Tensorflow, and Firebase.We collaborated on GitHub and Replit to share our code

## Challenges we ran into
We never knew how to use firebase, but we learned and made a chat feature out of it. We also were in a different timezone which made it tough to collaborate.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to make something that can be very helpful for a persons day to day life to boost his mental and physical health. We are able to make all features we thought of including chatbot, consulting feature emotion analyzer, and many more. Also being beginners, We gave our best and learned new things during this hack.

## What we learned
We learned new stuff like  NLP, Tensorflow, Firebase, Google Cloud, Bootstrap, and most importantly Time management. We are all still learning to integrate new stuff into our projects so we learned a lot at this Hackathon.

## What's next for Yogify
We will be making a full-fledged site for fitness enthusiasts to spend their time here on yogify.
